Task 1: create an API endpoint that returns the number of stars for a given Github repository.

Requirements:

Build an API endpoint that:

Implements a GET request with a sensible path (for example, /github/repo_info)

Takes in a parameter of "repo_name" (or repoName, if you prefer)

This should be the organization/owner name, and then the repo name

Example: "facebook/react"

Queries the Github API for that repo name

Parses the response, and then returns (as JSON):

Repo name (same as passed in)

Repo Description

Number of stars

Return a 404 if the given repository is not found

Add tests

Extend it to take in (and return) an array of repos, or simply an owner/organization name, and return the above data for all of their repos.

Task 2: given this CSV as a model, implement a NodeJs script including a Javascript function that would be the backend for a search-as-you-type widget.
read and parse the CSV file (efficiently), we just care about the text column, ignore the other one

( do the reading/parsing manually, do not use any of the CSV libs out there )
write a function that given a search term produces a json with search results that match the data from the CSV file

how would you test it?

//Run npm install
// "npm start" to start server
// "npm test"  to run test


//End Points
 // => /github/repo_info/owner/repo_name
            // '&' is used as delimetr to pass in array of owner name and repo name

 //Test Sample 
        // => http://localhost:8080/github/repo_info/charlax/professional-programming
        // => http://localhost:8080/github/repo_info/charlax&goldbergyoni/professional-programming&javascript-testing-best-practices

// => /search/searchString 
    //Test Sample
        //http://localhost:8080/search/Growing
        //http://localhost:8080/search/Activities

//Q2 solution might not be the best solution ; )
